# Twilio Texter -or- A project that suits my needs and maybe no one else's

A simple way to text with multiple phone numbers using Python. I have been looking for a way to text and make calls using my twilio numbers for a while now and haven't had much luck with any good methods. So this is my attempt at making something useful for myself and possibly other people.

This is also the first time I have seriously used Python, so prepare to look at horrible code.

## This project is in pre-alpha stages. It's barely even useable just yet. 

This application does require a Twilio account and a bunch of dependencies that I will have to sort out later.
